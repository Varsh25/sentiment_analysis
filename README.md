## 🌿 Skincare Reviews Sentiment Analysis 🛍️  
A **machine learning model** that classifies **Skincare product reviews** as **Positive 😊 or Negative 😞** based on sentiment.  

📊 **Dataset Used: **[Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/melissamonfared/sephora-skincare-reviews/data)**  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **real customer reviews** of **Skincare products** to determine whether the sentiment is **positive or negative**.  
It helps in understanding:  
- **Customer satisfaction** with skincare products.  
- **Common complaints or praises** about different brands.  
- **Market trends** based on user feedback.  

### 🛠 Built with  
✅ **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression for sentiment classification)  
✅ **TF-IDF Vectorization** (for text preprocessing)  
✅ **Gradio** (for an interactive web app)  
✅ **Hugging Face Spaces** (for deployment & sharing)

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1️⃣ **User enters a skincare product review.**  
2️⃣ **Text is preprocessed** (lowercased, cleaned, and vectorized using TF-IDF).  
3️⃣ **The trained ML model predicts sentiment** (`Positive` or `Negative`).  
4️⃣ **Displays a confidence score** showing how certain the model is.

## 📌 Example Output  

| **Input**                           | **Sentiment**  | **Confidence** |
|-------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Works like magic, just go for it!   | **Positive** | **99.72%**    |
| Don't waste your money on this.     | **Negative** | **99.42%**    |
